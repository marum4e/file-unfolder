# file-unfolder
unfolders files from folders. 99.4% vibe coded ;)

## how to use :
1. place the pyw file in the folder where all the files will be placed
2. the folders also should be in the same folder as the program
3. run the program and select the folder you want to take files out from
4. files will be in the same place as your program
5. re run the program or click the refolder button (which just restarts it) to put your files back

## note
- **your files will be put back if u exit and re enter the program**

- folders inside folders will show a prompt but the folders will not be moved with this program

- moved_files.txt might be created these can be safely deleted if your files are where they were before unfoldering

- this was all gpt and i made this mainly to sort my minecraft mods without getting a new launcher
